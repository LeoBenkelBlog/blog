# Test article

This is an experiment to test [GitPress@LeoBenkel](https://gitpress.io/@leobenkel)

## Code?

Will code render properly:

```
val test = 2 

val more = test + 5

def add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b
```

## List?

Would list work as well ? 

* this is the first one
* This is second

1. numbered list too ? 
1. really?
